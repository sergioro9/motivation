## Todo

  [ ] read ref 1

## Notes

  * insightful comment in ref 3: Don't complicate your life trying to
    read a json file in JS, that's kinda stupid since if you have the
    files locally you can just wrap them into a define call and if it is
    on your server you can just load it as text and parse the JSON data,
    but you get the idea..
